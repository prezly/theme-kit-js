# This is a reusable workflow that can be used to run Playwright tests on Prezly Theme deployments.
# The workflow that is using this reusable workflow should be triggered by `deployment_status` event.
# The `site-name` input should be filled with the name of the site that is being deployed on the preview.
# See example usage in the Bea repo: https://github.com/prezly/theme-nextjs-bea/blob/main/.github/workflows/playwright.yml
# See GitHub docs on shared workflows: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#calling-a-reusable-workflow
